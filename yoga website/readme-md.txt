## Customization Guide

### General Content

1. Replace all placeholder content with your actual information:
   - Update all text sections, service details, pricing, etc.
   - Replace "Serene Yoga" with your actual business name throughout the site.
   - Update contact information, service areas, and business hours.

### Images

1. Replace all placeholder images with your own high-quality images:
   - The website uses placeholder images with the URL pattern `/api/placeholder/width/height`.
   - Replace these with your own images by:
     - Adding your images to the `/images` folder.
     - Updating the image paths in the HTML files (e.g., change `/api/placeholder/600/400` to `/images/your-image.jpg`).

### Color Scheme

1. To change the color scheme, edit the CSS variables in the `css/styles.css` file:
   - Look for the `:root` section at the beginning of the file.
   - Update the color values to match your preferred palette.
   - Main colors to change:
     - `--primary-color` (Currently a sage green)
     - `--secondary-color` (Currently a warm sand)
     - `--accent-color` (Currently a soft rose)

### Fonts

1. To change the fonts:
   - Update the Google Fonts link in the `<head>` section of each HTML file.
   - Update the font-family variables in the CSS `:root` section:
     - `--heading-font` (Currently 'Playfair Display')
     - `--body-font` (Currently 'Raleway')

### Adding New Pages

1. To add a new page:
   - Create a new HTML file in the `/pages` folder.
   - Copy the structure from an existing page, including the header and footer.
   - Update the navigation menu in all HTML files to include a link to your new page.

### Integrating Scheduling Tools

1. To integrate a scheduling tool like Calendly:
   - Sign up for a Calendly account (or similar service).
   - Replace the "View Availability Calendar" button on the contact page with your scheduling link or embed code.
