                    <h3>Benefits of Home Practice:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Comfort and privacy of your own space</li>
                        <li>No commute time or packing yoga gear</li>

                    <h3>What to Expect:</h3>
                    <p>Before our first session, I'll discuss your goals and any physical considerations. During our initial meeting, I'll assess your space to design a practice that works optimally in your home. All you need is enough room for a yoga mat and some clear space around it. I can provide a mat and props if needed, or guide you on what might be useful to purchase for your ongoing practice.</p>
                    <p>Sessions typically last 60-90 minutes, including time for discussion about your progress and any questions you may have.</p>

                    <h2>Outdoor Yoga Sessions</h2>
                    <p>Connect with nature while deepening your yoga practice in the fresh air of parks, gardens, beaches, or any outdoor space you prefer.</p>
                    <h3>Benefits of Outdoor Practice:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enhanced connection with nature</li>
                        <li>Fresh air and natural light</li>

                    <h3>What to Expect:</h3>
                    <p>Outdoor sessions are thoughtfully planned around weather conditions and location features. I'll help you select an ideal spot that offers both beauty and privacy. Together, we'll adapt the practice to embrace the natural environment, incorporating elements like trees for balance poses or gentle slopes for varying intensity.</p>
                    <p>I recommend bringing sunscreen, water, and layered clothing for changing conditions. Sessions typically last 60-90 minutes and can be scheduled during sunrise, sunset, or any time that works for your schedule and the chosen location.</p>

                    <h3>Benefits of Venue Practice:</h3>

                    <p>Venue sessions are highly adaptable to the location and group dynamics. For workplace settings, I can offer shorter sessions that fit into lunch breaks or before/after work hours. For community centers or dedicated yoga spaces, we can arrange longer, more comprehensive practices.</p>
                    <p>I'll work with you to understand the venue's layout and facilities to ensure a smooth experience. For group sessions, I balance individual attention with collective energy, creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels supported regardless of their yoga experience.</p>
